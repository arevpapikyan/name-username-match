# Name-Username Confidence Level Checker

This project provides a set of Python scripts to determine the confidence level that a given username corresponds to a full name, considering possible nicknames and variations. This can be particularly useful for user account verification, data cleaning, and identity resolution.

## Files

- `example.py`: Demonstrates how to use the utility functions to calculate confidence levels for various name-username pairs.
- `functions.py`: Contains utility functions for loading nicknames, normalizing names and usernames, and calculating similarity and confidence levels.
- `nicknames.txt`: A text file containing a list of nicknames and their corresponding full names.
